# Godot RTS Entity Controller

This addon is a comprehensive toolkit for creating RTS games in Godot, using a modular entity-component composition approach to select, move and attack other entities and provide the same basic functionalities as in games such as StarCraft 2 or Warcraft 3.

Extend or add components to customize your units and provide additional behavior, or simply use the components as they are to jumpstart your RTS/RTT game development and learn about RTS implementations in Godot.

Includes a sample unit and ready to play scene.
